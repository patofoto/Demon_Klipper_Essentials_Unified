Its always very much appreciated & anything you do send goes towards helping me continue putting my ideas out there for the whole 3D printing community. Sending even a little makes a difference! Thank you & happy printing!!

****************************************************************************************************************************
### IF YOU RAN V1.0-V2.8 BE SURE TO UPDATE YOUR SLICER'S START GCODE OR NEW FEATURES WONT WORK!
**Also you must update ALL the macro files as this new version will NOT work correctly with old files!**
****************************************************************************************************************************

- ### [UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION CLICK HERE!!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Other_Files/Version_Config_Changes/V2.9_Config_Changes.md)

### Orca Slicer

Make sure you have the latest 2.2.0 (beta2 or later) version of Orca Slicer DO NOT USE ORCA SLICER DOT NET!!! BAD!!!

This link GOOD!

# Edit your printer.cfg 

Be sure your `printer.cfg` file `[extruder]` section contains...

```
max_extrude_only_velocity: 15
```
This is used by the load/unload macros & is converted into feedrate of mm/s & is limited to 20

```
[idle_timeout]
gcode:
    _DEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT
timeout: 3600
```

This will call the new Demon timeout macro after 1 hour & execute the functions of your choice in the demon_user_settings file. You csan set the time (seconds) to anything you like.


YOU MUST, I REPEAT MUST DISABLE ALL THE SOVOL MACROS BY COMMENTING OUT THE macro.cfg FILE INCLUDE IN THE printer.cfg FILE! 
To do this use a # at the start of the line like this:
```
# [include Macro.cfg]
```
Then set your fans like this in the printer.cfg file:
```
[multi_pin fan_pins]
pins: extra_mcu:PA7, extra_mcu:PB1

[fan]
pin:multi_pin: fan_pins
max_power: 1.0
shutdown_speed: 0
kick_start_time: 0.5
off_below: 0.10
```
Comment out the stock entry do not delete it, it must look like this:
```
# [fan_generic fan0] # back model cooling fan
# pin: extra_mcu:PA7
# max_power: 1.0

# [fan_generic fan1] # front model cooling fan
# pin: extra_mcu:PB1
# max_power: 1.0
```

Rename the `[output_pin Main_LED]` section & change the cycle_time. As the stock value of `5` is incorrect. 

```
[output_pin Printer_Lights]
pin:PA3
pwm: 1
value:1
cycle_time: 0.01
shutdown_value: 0
```

Be sure to comment out the Sovol [homing_override] section if you want to use the demon_homing_control file. If not leave this commented in & disable the demon file by commenting out its full content.

```
# [homing_override]
# gcode:
#    {% if not 'Z' in params and not 'Y' in params and 'X' in params %}
#      G28 X
#      G0 X348 F1200
#    {% elif not 'Z' in params and not 'X' in params and 'Y' in params %}
#      G28 Y
#      G0 Y360  F1200
#    {% elif not 'Z' in params and 'X' in params and 'Y' in params %}
#      G28 Y
#      G0 Y360  F1200
#      G4 P2000
#      G28 X
#      G0 X348  F1200
#    {% elif 'Z' in params and not 'X' in params and not 'Y' in params %}
#      G90
#      G0  X191 Y165 F3600
#      G28 Z
#      G0  Z10 F600
#    {% else %}
#      G90
#      G0 Z5 F300
#      G28 Y
#      G0 Y360  F1200
#      G4 P2000
#      G28 X
#      G0 X348  F1200
#      G90
#      G0  X191 Y165 F3600
#      G28 Z
#      G0  Z10 F600
#    {% endif %}
# axes: xyz
# set_position_z: 0
```

Now... There's one more thing I really recommend doing & that's modifying the settings below for your meshing & probing sections! This will improve the accuracy of your system when using the probe. Do check these values against your current values & DO NOT overwrite your stock sections!! Comment them out & paste these in below them so you can always go back if you need to!

THIS FIRST SECTION IS OPTIONAL TO SLOW THE MACHINE DOWN - as the stock settings are waaaaaaaaay too fast & are unrealistic.
```

max_accel: 8200
max_accel_to_decel: 4500

```
 
```
